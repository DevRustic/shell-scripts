# shell-scripts
Simply a repo that contains a few shell scripts. These assist in deploying new Ubuntu VM's.

Scripts:
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevRustic/shell-scripts/refs/heads/main/setup_server.ssh)"

## Note:
This script is entirely written by Chatgpt. I have not changed, written, or even looked at this code for over 13 seconds.
